**Slice by Slice** is an educational pizza restaurant simulator designed to teach **fraction concepts** to 4th-grade students through interactive gameplay. Players take on the role of a pizza chef who must correctly fulfill fractional pizza orders from customers while managing toppings, deliveries, and daily goals.

The game combines **hands-on math learning** with a fun, visual, and engaging experience that reinforces fraction representation and comparison through gameplay challenges and mini-games.

## Learning Goals
Our learning goals align with Common Core 4th-grade math standards for fractions.  
By the end of the game, students will be able to:

1. **Represent** proper and improper fractions up to a denominator of 8.  
2. **Compare** proper and improper fractions (greater than, less than, equal to) up to a denominator of 8.

These goals are **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound), ensuring that players gain tangible learning outcomes as they progress.

## Development Progress

### Sprint 1: Base structure Setup
Goal: Build the fundamental structure of the game.

### Sprint 2: Gameplay Expansion
Goal: Implement the main gameplay and logic that was blocked by the setup phase.
