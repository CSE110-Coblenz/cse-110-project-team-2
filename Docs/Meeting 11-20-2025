11/20/2025 Meeting (Virtual)

Attendees: Woojin, Michelle, Randy, Johnny, Jolene, Teddy

Agenda: 
  1. User Studies Discussion Reflections

Notes:
  1. Topping removal tool removes every type of topping instead of just one at a time (Jolene, Pre-Game Tasks)
  2. Sound effects were too loud (Teddy, Main-Game)
  3. Don't like dragging toppings, would prefer to click and select. Midpoint should be accounted for in the line boundary, that should be made clear. (Johnny, Main Game)
  4. Tongs are really easy to forgo and not understand if they don't read game instructions. Do not like 16 slices options as it takes too long and repetitive, want a skip button (Woojin, Main Game)
  5. Easy to play, can add big puddles, different obstacles(Michelle, Mini Game)
  6. Music gets repetitive, bugs while playing the game, not accurate roughly 10% of the time (Randy, Main Game)
