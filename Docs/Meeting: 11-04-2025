11/03/2025 (In-class) - Retrospective Meeting 

Notes:
  What went well?
    - Assigning and delegating tasks via GitHub issue
    - Communicating issues and updating progress
    - Team bonding :)
    - Openness to feedback

  What can be improved?
    - Getting work done early/on schedule 
    - Opening more PRs
    - Being productive in meetings
      😭❤️😛👀
    - Reviewing PRs and their comments in a quicker manner (unrealistic to completely address because we’re busy with individual schedules)
    - We can all take leadership roles
    - Playing League instead of work [at late hours though :( ]
    - Halloween + midterms (Busy as a result)

  What will you commit to improving in the next sprint?
    - Working to a more set schedule 
    - Starting earlier (most of us started, later in the week)
